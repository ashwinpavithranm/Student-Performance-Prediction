    ## Problem Statement
    Many students struggle with academic performance due to various factors such as attendance, study habits, distractions, and anxiety levels. 
    Identifying at-risk students early can help provide necessary interventions to improve their outcomes.
    
    ## Solution
    This app uses a machine learning model to analyze key factors influencing student performance and predict whether a student is likely to pass or fail.
    By providing insights based on data, educators and students can take proactive steps to enhance learning strategies.

    This application predicts student performance based on several factors like attendance, study habits, and anxiety levels.
    
    **Key Features Considered:**
    - Attendance percentage
    - Weekly study hours
    - Previous exam score
    - Sleep hours per day
    - Number of distractions
    - Extracurricular activities
    - Test anxiety level
    
    **How It Works:**
    The model uses machine learning techniques to analyze student data and determine whether they are likely to pass or fail.
    
    **Disclaimer:**
    This prediction is based on past data and should not be taken as a definitive result.
